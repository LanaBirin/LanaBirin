## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Lana

I'm just starting my journey in UX/UI design, with a clear goal: to create interfaces that are stylish, intuitive, and well-structured.  With a background in visual content creation, I'm transitioning into the tech world to blend creativity with functionality.

ðŸŽ¯ Focus: aesthetics, logic, clarity 

For now, this space is quiet and empty â€” but every project starts with a blank page.  
This profile is part of the process, and I'm here to build it step by step, with attention and intent â™¥

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: HTML basics â€” and how not to panic every time I hear a new technical term
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: projects that arenâ€™t necessarily conventional or polished â€” but have intention, visual clarity, and a sense of meaning behind them.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with navigating technical tools without losing my love for aesthetics and  clarity
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: how it feels to start from scratch  
(spoiler: absolutely chaotic and confusing â€” but strangely captivating)

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns:  she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I always notice when a button is 2px off, but I still forget where I put my keys and where I left my phone
